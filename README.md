## Why gosh-dl?

gosh-dl brings download functionality directly into your Rust application as a native library, eliminating the complexity of managing external processes, parsing JSON-RPC responses, or bundling platform-specific binaries. Modern applications demand seamless integration, and gosh-dl delivers exactly that; async function calls that feel natural in your codebase, compile-time type safety that catches errors before runtime, and shared memory that keeps your application lightweight and responsive.

Whether you're building a media application that needs BitTorrent with streaming support, a package manager requiring resilient HTTP downloads with checksums and mirrors, or any software that moves files across the network, gosh-dl provides the complete feature set you need. Multi-connection acceleration splits large downloads across parallel connections for maximum throughput. Automatic resume with ETag validation ensures interrupted transfers pick up exactly where they left off. Full BitTorrent support includes DHT for trackerless operation, peer exchange for efficient swarm discovery, and protocol encryption for privacy.

The engine handles the complexity of segmented downloads, tracker communication, DHT peer discovery, and connection encryption while exposing a clean, intuitive API that integrates naturally with Tokio-based applications. Priority queues let you control which downloads matter most, bandwidth scheduling adapts to time-of-day constraints, and persistence — built-in SQLite, JSON sidecar files, or your own `Storage` implementation — ensures nothing is lost across restarts.

A standalone CLI is available in the companion `gosh-dl-cli` project for users who want command-line access to the engine.

## Quick Start

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
gosh-dl = "0.5"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

To enable recursive HTTP directory mirroring:

```toml
[dependencies]
gosh-dl = { version = "0.5", features = ["recursive-http"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Basic usage:

```rust
use gosh_dl::{DownloadEngine, EngineConfig, DownloadOptions};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let engine = DownloadEngine::new(EngineConfig::default()).await?;

    // HTTP download
    let id = engine.add_http(
        "https://example.com/file.zip",
        DownloadOptions::default(),
    ).await?;

    // Subscribe to progress events
    let mut events = engine.subscribe();
    while let Ok(event) = events.recv().await {
        println!("Event: {:?}", event);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

## API Overview

All public types are available at the crate root via re-exports. For explicit imports, use `gosh_dl::protocol`:

```rust
use gosh_dl::protocol::{DownloadEvent, DownloadStatus, ProtocolError};
```

### Download Management

```rust
// Add downloads
let http_id = engine.add_http(url, options).await?;
let torrent_id = engine.add_torrent(&torrent_bytes, options).await?;
let magnet_id = engine.add_magnet(magnet_uri, options).await?;

// Control
engine.pause(id).await?;
engine.resume(id).await?;
engine.cancel(id, delete_files).await?;

// Batch control (aria2 pauseAll/unpauseAll analogs).
// Pauses queued downloads too, and returns per-download outcomes.
let result = engine.pause_all().await;
println!("paused {}, skipped {}", result.succeeded.len(), result.skipped.len());
engine.resume_all().await;
engine.cancel_all(delete_files).await;

// Priority
engine.set_priority(id, DownloadPriority::High)?;

// Status
let status = engine.status(id);
let all = engine.list();
let active = engine.active();
let waiting = engine.waiting();
let stopped = engine.stopped();
let stats = engine.global_stats();
```

With `recursive-http` enabled:

```rust
let manifest = engine
    .discover_http_recursive(root_url, &options, &recursive_options)
    .await?;

let job = engine
    .add_http_recursive(root_url, options, recursive_options)
    .await?;

let aggregate = engine.recursive_job_status(&job);
println!(
    "{:?} ({}/{})",
    aggregate.state,
    aggregate.progress.completed_children,
    aggregate.progress.total_children,
);

let tracked = engine.list_recursive_jobs();
println!("tracked jobs: {}", tracked.len());

if let Some(parent) = tracked.first() {
    let mut recursive_events = engine.subscribe_recursive_jobs();
    engine.cancel_recursive_job(parent.id, false).await?;
    engine.remove_recursive_job(parent.id, false).await?;

    for _ in 0..2 {
        if let Ok(event) = recursive_events.recv().await {
            println!("recursive event: {:?}", event);
        }
    }
}
```

### Download Options

```rust
use gosh_dl::{DownloadOptions, DownloadPriority, ExpectedChecksum};

let options = DownloadOptions {
    priority: DownloadPriority::High,
    save_dir: Some(PathBuf::from("/downloads")),
    filename: Some("custom_name.zip".to_string()),
    user_agent: Some("MyApp/1.0".to_string()),
    referer: Some("https://example.com".to_string()),
    headers: vec![("Authorization".to_string(), "Bearer token".to_string())],
    cookies: Some(vec!["session=abc123".to_string()]),
    checksum: ExpectedChecksum::parse("sha256:abcd1234..."),
    mirrors: vec!["https://mirror1.example.com/file.zip".to_string()],
    max_connections: Some(8),
    max_download_speed: Some(5 * 1024 * 1024), // 5 MB/s
    // Torrent-specific
    selected_files: Some(vec![0, 2, 5]), // Download only specific files
    sequential: Some(true), // For streaming playback
    ..Default::default()
};
```

### Recursive HTTP

When the `recursive-http` feature is enabled, the engine also exposes `RecursiveOptions`:

```rust
use gosh_dl::RecursiveOptions;

let recursive = RecursiveOptions {
    max_depth: 4,
    include_patterns: vec!["*.txt".to_string()],
    exclude_patterns: vec!["private/*".to_string()],
    ..Default::default()
};
```

Current scope:

- crawls HTML directory/index pages and follows `<a href>` links
- same-host only by default
- constrained to the root path prefix by default
- discovered files are queued as ordinary HTTP downloads
- rolls back already-added child downloads if recursive enqueue fails partway through
- optional `fail_fast` cancels queued/active sibling child downloads after the first child failure
- persists recursive child runtime context needed for redirect-scope and fail-fast recovery
- persists tracked parent recursive jobs and restores them on restart
- exposes aggregate parent status, lifecycle methods, and a dedicated parent event stream
- propagates headers, cookies, user-agent, and referer during discovery
- discovery fetches pages concurrently, bounded by `max_discovery_concurrency` (default 4)

Current limitations:

- opt-in via the `recursive-http` Cargo feature
- not full `wget -r` parity
- no JavaScript rendering
- recursive parent jobs use a separate event stream via `subscribe_recursive_jobs()`, not the main `DownloadEvent` stream
- recursive redirect scope is enforced in discovery, child file downloads, and resumed child downloads restored from storage, but recursive jobs are still not resumable as crawls
- recursive jobs are persisted and listable, but still do not participate in the main download queue/event model as first-class parent downloads
- no persisted parent-level event or progress history beyond the tracked job record itself

### Events

```rust
use gosh_dl::DownloadEvent;

let mut events = engine.subscribe();
while let Ok(event) = events.recv().await {
    match event {
        DownloadEvent::Added { id } => println!("Added: {}", id),
        DownloadEvent::Started { id } => println!("Started: {}", id),
        DownloadEvent::Progress { id, progress } => {
            println!("{}: {:.1}% at {} KB/s",
                id,
                progress.percentage(),
                progress.download_speed / 1024
            );
        }
        DownloadEvent::StateChanged { id, old_state, new_state } => {
            println!("{}: {:?} -> {:?}", id, old_state, new_state);
        }
        DownloadEvent::Completed { id } => println!("Done: {}", id),
        DownloadEvent::Failed { id, error, retryable } => {
            eprintln!("Failed {}: {} (retryable: {})", id, error, retryable);
        }
        DownloadEvent::Paused { id } => println!("Paused: {}", id),
        DownloadEvent::Resumed { id } => println!("Resumed: {}", id),
        DownloadEvent::Removed { id } => println!("Removed: {}", id),
    }
}
```

## Configuration

```rust
use gosh_dl::{EngineConfig, HttpConfig, TorrentConfig};
use gosh_dl::config::WebSeedConfig;
use std::path::PathBuf;

let config = EngineConfig {
    download_dir: PathBuf::from("/downloads"),
    max_concurrent_downloads: 5,
    max_connections_per_download: 16,
    min_segment_size: 1024 * 1024, // 1 MB
    global_download_limit: Some(10 * 1024 * 1024), // 10 MB/s
    global_upload_limit: Some(5 * 1024 * 1024), // 5 MB/s
    user_agent: "MyApp/1.0".to_string(),
    enable_dht: true,
    enable_pex: true,
    enable_lpd: true,
    max_peers: 55,
    seed_ratio: 1.0,
    database_path: Some(PathBuf::from("/data/gosh-dl.db")),
    http: HttpConfig {
        max_retries: 8,
        read_timeout: 90,
        ..Default::default()
    },
    torrent: TorrentConfig {
        webseed: WebSeedConfig {
            enabled: true,
            max_connections: 6,
            ..Default::default()
        },
        ..Default::default()
    },
    ..Default::default()
};
```

You can also apply a replacement config at runtime with `engine.set_config(config)?;`.
Queue concurrency and global bandwidth limits are applied to the live engine when you do this.

### Persistence & Custom Storage

Setting `database_path` persists download state to the built-in SQLite storage
(`storage` feature) so downloads resume across restarts. If you maintain your
own metadata store — or just prefer plain files — inject any implementation of
the `Storage` trait instead:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use gosh_dl::{DownloadEngine, EngineConfig, FileStorage};

// aria2-control-file style JSON sidecars, one per download:
let storage = Arc::new(FileStorage::new("/data/gosh-dl-state").await?);
let engine = DownloadEngine::with_storage(EngineConfig::default(), storage).await?;
```

`FileStorage` (JSON sidecar files) and `MemoryStorage` ship with the crate and
work without the `storage` feature. To bring your own database, implement the
`Storage` trait (the `#[async_trait]` attribute is re-exported from
`gosh_dl::storage`) and pass it to `DownloadEngine::with_storage`.

### Bandwidth Scheduling

```rust
use gosh_dl::{EngineConfig, ScheduleRule};

// Limit bandwidth during work hours (Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm)
let work_hours = ScheduleRule::weekdays(
    9,                      // start_hour
    17,                     // end_hour
    Some(1024 * 1024),      // download_limit: 1 MB/s
    None,                   // upload_limit: unlimited
);

let config = EngineConfig::default()
    .add_schedule_rule(work_hours);
```

## Building

cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo doc --open
```

## Why an API Instead of RPC?

Traditional download managers like aria2 use JSON-RPC for external communication. This works well for standalone tools, but creates friction when embedding download functionality into applications:

**With RPC (aria2 approach):**
```
Your App → Serialize JSON → HTTP/WebSocket → aria2 Process → Parse JSON → Execute
         ← Parse JSON    ← HTTP/WebSocket  ←              ← Serialize JSON ← Result
```

**With native API (gosh-dl approach):**
```
Your App → engine.add_http(url, opts) → Result
```

### Benefits of the API Approach

- **Zero serialization overhead**: No JSON encoding/decoding on every call. Function arguments pass directly through memory.
- **Compile-time guarantees**: The Rust compiler catches type mismatches, missing parameters, and invalid states before your code runs. RPC errors only surface at runtime.
- **Native error handling**: Use `?` operator, pattern matching on `Result`, and standard Rust error propagation. No parsing error strings from JSON responses.
- **No process coordination**: No need to spawn aria2, monitor if it crashed, restart it, or manage its lifecycle. The engine lives in your process.
- **Shared memory space**: Progress callbacks, event streams, and status queries happen in-process. No IPC latency or message queue bottlenecks.
- **Single deployment artifact**: Ship one binary. No bundling platform-specific aria2 executables or dealing with PATH issues.
- **IDE integration**: Autocomplete, go-to-definition, inline docs all work. RPC calls are opaque strings to your editor.

## Comparison with aria2

gosh-dl was designed as a native Rust alternative to [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/), the popular C++ download utility. While aria2 is excellent as a standalone tool, embedding it in applications requires spawning an external process and communicating via JSON-RPC.

| Aspect | aria2 | gosh-dl |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Integration** | External process + JSON-RPC | Native library calls |
| **Deployment** | Bundle platform binaries | Single Rust crate |
| **Type Safety** | JSON strings | Rust types with compile-time checks |
| **Error Handling** | Parse JSON responses | Native `Result<T, E>` |
| **Process Management** | Handle lifecycle, crashes | None required |
| **Memory** | Separate process | Shared with your app |

### Migration Guide

| aria2 RPC | gosh-dl |
|-----------|---------|
| `aria2.addUri(urls)` | `engine.add_http(url, opts)` |
| `aria2.addTorrent(torrent)` | `engine.add_torrent(bytes, opts)` |
| `aria2.pause(gid)` | `engine.pause(id)` |
| `aria2.unpause(gid)` | `engine.resume(id)` |
| `aria2.pauseAll()` | `engine.pause_all()` |
| `aria2.unpauseAll()` | `engine.resume_all()` |
| `aria2.remove(gid)` | `engine.cancel(id, false)` |
| `aria2.tellStatus(gid)` | `engine.status(id)` |
| `aria2.tellActive()` | `engine.active()` |
| `aria2.tellWaiting()` | `engine.waiting()` |
| `aria2.tellStopped()` | `engine.stopped()` |
| `aria2.getGlobalStat()` | `engine.global_stats()` |
| `aria2.changeOption(gid, {priority})` | `engine.set_priority(id, priority)` |

## FAQ

### Why not just use aria2?

aria2 is a battle-tested download utility and remains an excellent choice for many use cases. Use aria2 if:

- You need a standalone command-line tool
- You're scripting downloads from shell or other languages
- You want a mature, widely-deployed solution with years of production use

Use gosh-dl if:

- You're building a Rust application and want download functionality as a library
- You need tight integration without IPC overhead
- You want compile-time type safety and native async/await
- You prefer not to bundle and manage external binaries
- You need direct access to download state without polling JSON-RPC

Both tools support similar feature sets (multi-connection HTTP, BitTorrent, DHT, etc.). The difference is architectural: aria2 is a standalone process you communicate with, gosh-dl is a library you call directly.

### Is there a CLI?

A standalone `gosh-dl` CLI application is now available and can be found here: [gosh-dl-cli](https://github.com/goshitsarch-eng/gosh-dl-cli). It allows command-line access to all engine features for users who prefer terminal workflows or need to script downloads without writing Rust code.

### What Rust version is required?

gosh-dl requires Rust 1.85+ for async trait support.

### Does gosh-dl work on Windows?

Yes. gosh-dl supports Linux, macOS, and Windows. Platform-specific code handles differences in file handling, network interfaces, and path conventions.
